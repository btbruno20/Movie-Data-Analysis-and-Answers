# **Business Recommendations for Microsoft:**
Presented by Sarah Jack, Ben Ywani and, Brendan Bruno in associaion with the Logos Analytics Group.

**Overview**
The following project displays our expert business reccomendations for Microsoft's forthcoming movie studio. Our analysis was shaped by the indutrail film making process: pre-production, production and, post-production. Our first analysis concerns the pre-production phase, which examines what genres of films Microsoft should craft. The second analysis is grounded in the production phase and gives concrete suggestions about how long the films should run for. Finally, the third analysis regards the post-production stage and proposes the most successful release month for films in the calendar year. [By utilizing industry data from The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/ "The Numbers") [and the Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/ "the Internet Movie Database") (IMDb) we developed three suggesstions for Microsoft. First, the most profitable movie genres include Animation, Adventure, Science-Fiction, Mystery and, Comedy. Second, films that runn between 80-125 minutes inn total garner the largest returns on investment. Third, films relleased in January, June, JUly and, November see the greatset returnns on ivesment relatiive to other release months. 

**Businesss Understanding**
Microsoft is considering an expansion into the long-form entertainment industry by way of feature film. In doing so, Microsoft will be able to contribute to the growing market of artistic expression by supporting both creators and patrons of the arts. The forthcoming studio will enhance Microsoft's presence on the global stage as a multidimensional tech company and benefactor of visionaries everywhere. 

**Data**
Our team diligently collected industry data from The Numbers and IMDb. The Numbers is a continoulsy updated database that houses information for over 50,000 films. IMDb is an online database and subsidiary of Amazon that contains information for thousands of actors, writers, films, television programs, feature length and short films and more. We compiled data from both sources into a master dataset which contains information about each film's title, genre, production costs, gross domestic profit, international profit, domestic return on investment in percentage, international return on investment in percentage and,the month of release. An important note about the data from The Numbers is that the database does not adjusst for inflation. The master dataset includes thousands of films, this robust sample size allows our team to make concrete reccomendations

**Methods**
 The team used descriptive analystics to examine the relationships between both domestic and worldwide ROI with film release months, runtimes and, genres. 

**Results**

**Figure 1A: Domestic ROI in Percentage and Film Genres**


**Figure 1B: Worldwide ROI in Percentage and Film Genres**

**Analysis of Figures 1A and 1B:**
In analyzing the median return on investment for film genres, we find that the genres with the most potential for maxiumum ROI are Animation, Adventure, SciFi, Mystery, and Comedy. Because of the robust sample size and our focus on the mediian measure we can discount the possibility of potential outliers influencing our data, thus we can confidently assert our findings.

**Figure 2A: Domestic ROI in Percentage and Film Runtime in Minutes

**Figure 2B: Worldwide ROI in Percentage and Film Runtime in Minutes

**Analysis of Figures 2A and 2B******
Our findings suggest that most films are between 80 - 125 minutes with an average runtime of 102 minutes. Domestic mean average ROI is about 98% compared to worldwide which is around 270% in ROI. We recommend Microsoft Studios to produce movies between 80 - 125 minutes of runtime.

**Figure 3B: Worldwide ROI in Percentage by Release Month **

**Analysis of Figures 3A and 3B**
Based on the analysis, the median domestic return on investment (ROI) is highest for movies released during June, July, and November relative to other months. Because domestic ROI only captures financial gains and losses within the filmâ€™s country of origin, worldwide ROI paints a clearer picture. Worldwide ROI includes both international and domestic ROI. Worldwide ROI displays that films released in January, June, July, and November see the largest relative return on investment. Future analysis may examine why these months see sizable returns on investment in contrast to other times during the calendar year. Possible explanations may include the release of Summer blockbusters, annual award seasons, or holidays.


**Conclusions**
From our preliminary findings Logos Analytics Group has compiled three suggestions for Microsoft's forthcoming movie studio. First, during the pre-production phase Microsoft should consider crafting films in the following genres: Animation, Adventure, Science-Fiction, Mystery and,Comedy. Second, during the production phase Microsoft should encourage their writers and editors to produce films that run between 80 to 125 minutes long. Third, in the post-production phase Microsoft should aim to release their films duriing June, July, November or Januray. If Microsoft takes these considerations into mindd they should see a maxmized ROI both domestically andd internationally. 


**Next Steps**
The second phase of ths project would have the same team from the Logos Analytics Group examine why these genres, run times and release months amass the best ROIs both domestically and internationally. With input from the client the team could also analyze which actors, writers and storylines fit best wiithin the paramaters discussed above.
